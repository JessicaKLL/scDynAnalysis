\usage{
select_alter(data, Features, explicit = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A list containing the p-values of each feature between different time-points,
this can be calculated the function Between_variance()}

\item{Features}{Vector containing the names of the features}

\item{explicit}{Explicit selection? If not, the selection will be general (Default=TRUE)}
}
\value{
A vector of selected features
}
\description{
This function selects the features which present a significant variance among time-points
by selecting features which have p-value < alpha (0.05)
}
